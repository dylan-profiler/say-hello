# Type analyses

This directory contains structured analyses of the data types in the data sets included in this package.


Each analysis is structured in the following way:

- Read the data
- What data types do we expect provided a sample of the data? What are current problems?
- The data types provided by `pandas`
- The data types provided by `visions`
- Creation of custom data types and type set, if necessary.
